# Kafka and MQTT integration using Confluent Open Source

Based of the [kaiwaehner/kafka-connect-iot-mqtt-connector-example](https://github.com/kaiwaehner/kafka-connect-iot-mqtt-connector-example) presented at the 2018 Kafka summit in San Fransisco.
There is a [docker compose](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-docker-images/blob/5.0.1-post/examples/kafka-mqtt-single-node/docker-compose.yml) that forms the starting basis for this experimentation.
